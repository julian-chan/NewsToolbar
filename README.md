# NewsToolbar
### CalHacks 5.0

Our project creates a chromium extension that provides a ticker bar that shows breaking news to users. Users can customize and choose their favorite news sites to show on the ticker. We use machine learning to extract news from these news sites and compute the summary from large news contents. ML also allow us to assign a sentimental value to each news article.
